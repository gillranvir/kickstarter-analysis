### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1. Applying the COUNTIFS formula over the manually defined ranges of goal values was tedious and time consuming
2. Working with Github and Mark Down needed more focus and attention than the core Excel analysis itself

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The highest number of successful campaigns were launched in May of any given year
2. None of the campaigns launched in October of any year were canceled

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In general, campaigns with lower goals had higher success rate, the exception being that campaigns with goals ranging between 10,000 - 19,999 and between 35,000 - 44,9999 had similar success rates of slightly less than 50%

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Plotting Average Donation against Goal for campaigns with successful outcome
